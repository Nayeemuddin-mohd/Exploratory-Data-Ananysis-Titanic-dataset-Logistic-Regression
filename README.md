# Exploratory-Data-Ananysis-Titanic-dataset-Logistic-Regression
In statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task.

There are a number of tools that are useful for EDA, but EDA is characterized more by the attitude taken than by particular techniques.

Typical graphical techniques used in EDA are:

Box plot
Histogram
Multi-vari chart
Run chart
Pareto chart
Scatter plot
Stem-and-leaf plot
Parallel coordinates
Odds ratio

Dimensionality reduction:

Multidimensional scaling
Principal component analysis (PCA)
Multilinear PCA
Nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR)

Typical quantitative techniques are:

Median polish
Trimean
Ordination


We will use a semi cleaned version of the titanic data set, We'll be trying to predict a classification- survival or deceased using Logistic Regression in Python for classification.
